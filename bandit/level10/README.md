# Bandit Level 10 â†’ 11

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

This one seemed straightforward: a base64 decode. I quickly checked `man base64` just to confirm the usage.

Yep, it was as simple as `base64 -d data.txt`. And that's all it took!

# 1. How do I use base64?
