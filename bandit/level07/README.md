# Bandit Level 07 â†’ 08

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

I started by inspecting the file with `less data.txt`. I noticed each line contained a word paired with what looked like a password, separated by whitespaces.

Knowing the target word is "millionth," I used `grep millionth data.txt` and bingo!
