# Bandit Level 00 â†’ 01

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

This is the very first level of the Bandit wargame, designed to introduce the absolute basics of command-line interaction: navigating directories and reading file contents.

1. **Locate the File:** The challenge explicitly states the password is in a file named `readme` in the current directory. I'll use the `ls` command to verify its presence.
2. **Read the File Content:** Once confirmed, I'll use the `cat` command to display the content of the `readme` file, which should reveal the password.

```bash
# 1. List the contents of the current directory to verify 'readme' exists
