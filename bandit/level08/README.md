# Bandit Level 08 â†’ 09

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

Okay, first things first, I `less data.txt` to see what I was dealing with. Looks like a bunch of passwords, one per line.

The goal was to find the line that *doesn't* repeat. Looking at the suggested commands `uniq` looked like it might help, so I checked out `man uniq`. Boom! The `-u` or `--unique` option sounded exactly like what I needed: "only print unique lines."

So I tried `uniq -u data.txt`, but it still spit out a ton of lines. The file probably needs to be sorted first as some 'unique' algorithms work only for consecutive elements. Sorted it, and then `uniq -u` worked like a charm!
