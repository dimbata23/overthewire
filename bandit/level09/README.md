# Bandit Level 09 â†’ 10

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several â€˜=â€™ characters.

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

First off, I tried to `less data.txt`, but nope, it was a **binary file**.

Then, I saw `strings` is a suggested command. It pulled out just the human-readable text from the binary file!

The output had a lot of text, but I knew the password had a bunch of equals signs. So, I piped that into `grep` and searched for **`===`**.

`strings data.txt | grep ===`

Bingo!
