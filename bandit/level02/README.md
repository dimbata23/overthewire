# Bandit Level 02 â†’ 03

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Description

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process & Approach

After logging in and running `ls`, I immediately saw the file named `spaces in this filename`. Filenames with spaces can be tricky in the shell, but the standard solution is to enclose the whole name in quotes.

So, I tried `cat "spaces in this filename"`. It worked instantly, revealing the password. This level was a straightforward reminder that quoting is the key to handling filenames that include spaces.
