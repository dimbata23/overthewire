# 🕵️‍♂️ OverTheWire Wargames Solutions

> A collection of my solutions and walkthroughs for the wargames hosted on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). This repository serves as a learning journal, documenting my journey through various security concepts.

## 🚀 About

This repository documents my progress and solutions for the wargames provided by OverTheWire. Each wargame is designed to teach different aspects of cybersecurity, ranging from basic command-line proficiency to advanced exploitation techniques.

**My goal:** To systematically approach and solve each level, detailing my thought process, the commands used, and the insights gained.

**Disclaimer:** These solutions are provided for educational purposes and as a personal reference. I strongly encourage you to attempt solving the levels independently before consulting these notes. The real learning happens during the struggle!

## 📂 Structure

Each wargame will have its own dedicated directory. Within each wargame's directory, you'll find:

* **`README.md`**: An introductory overview of the wargame and a table of contents for its levels.
* **`levelXX/`**: Subdirectories for each individual level.
    * ✅ A working script or commands (`solution.sh`, `.py`, `.txt`, etc.)
    * 📖 A detailed `README.md` explaining the challenge, my approach, the commands executed, and the final solution.
